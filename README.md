## 🧪 Activity Descriptions

### 📂 Lab 1: Analyzing Titanic Dataset
- **Objective**: Clean and analyze the Titanic dataset from Kaggle.
- **Skills Applied**:
  - Loading and inspecting CSV data using pandas.
  - Handling missing data by filling or dropping values.
  - Calculating survival rate.
  - Comparing average ages of survivors vs. non-survivors.
- **Highlight**: Found that the survival rate was ~38.25% and survivors tended to be slightly younger.

### 📂 Lab 2: Titanic Dataset Cleaning and Visualization
- **Objective**: Enhance dataset cleaning and perform basic visual data analysis.
- **Skills Applied**:
  - Data cleaning: removing irrelevant columns, filling missing values, handling invalid entries.
  - Feature engineering: extracting titles and last names.
  - Data visualization with `matplotlib`.
- **Graphs Included**:
  - Average age by passenger class.
  - Passenger distribution by gender and class.
  - Fare comparison by gender.
- **Highlight**: Found that females paid higher average fares, likely due to higher-class ticket bookings.

### 📂 Lab 3: Introduction to SymPy
- **Objective**: Learn basic symbolic math operations using the SymPy library.
- **Skills Applied**:
  - Performing algebraic calculations like square roots and fractions.
  - Creating and simplifying symbolic equations.
  - Expanding expressions.
- **Highlight**: Explored how SymPy can handle symbolic logic and algebra similar to manual math steps.

---

### 📂 Lab 4: Exploring Calculus with SymPy
- **Objective**: Use SymPy to demonstrate calculus concepts like limits, derivatives, and series.
- **Skills Applied**:
  - Symbolic operations and expression manipulation.
  - Calculating limits and derivatives.
  - Expanding/Breaking down functions into a series of simpler terms (like x, x², x³) using Taylor or Maclaurin methods.
  - Solving algebraic equations.
- **Reflection**: Learned how symbolic computation can automate and visualize key calculus ideas, like finding the limit of sin(x)/x and deriving polynomials.
